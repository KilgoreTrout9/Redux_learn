Learning Redux through Wes Bos

the react-addons-css-transition-group moved into a directory in CSSTransitionGroup
  // New import statement is now:
  import CSSTransitionGroup from 'react-transition-group/CSSTransitionGroup';
  this should be a drop in change with nothing more needed to refactor

redbox-react not installed.  We are at React version 17 and this is a conflict with redbox apparently

react-addons-test-utils: This package is deprecated as of version 15.5.0:
  TestUtils have been moved to react-dom/test-utils

Styles written in stylus
